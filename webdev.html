												<h3>Mass General Brigham Hospital Java Application,  Software Lead</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Led the development of 20,000 line, full-stack Java application prototype as part of a 10 person, Agile Scrum team. We created a java application for employees of Mass General Brigham Hospital to use to make more than 9 different types of requests and be able to see those requests on a map of the hospital as well as the status of the request. My key contributions were leading the software team, resolving git conflicts and merges, discussing implentation and features. The features I implented were the voice command feature, and the social API. I also came up with the design for the dashboard using figma which the Mass General Brigham Hospital employees really liked. I also was in charge of primarily communication between backend and frontend. I would spend most of my time with backend team</p>

												<h3>VisNLP</h3>
											</header>
											<p>VisNLP stands for Visualizing Natural Language Processing. This is a project I worked on during June 2022 - August 2022. The goal was to make an interactive platform for novice learners to learn about how natural language processing works. I read many papers about different NLP algorithms such as word2vec. In this project I designed a UI interface using figma of how to platform would work to describe word2vec.</p>

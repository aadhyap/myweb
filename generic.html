									<p> Hi my name is Aadhya and I am an upcoming graduate from Worcester Polytechnic Institute majoring in Computer Science! <br />


										<br/>

										I first started coding by attending a MIT hackathon in highschool! Ever since then I attended more and ended up winning one! I then was so in love with the idea of students prototyping and the community of entrepreneurs that I helped organize a hackathon in Boston, MA called MA Hacks. I then had the oppurtunity to participate in MIT Beaverworks where I was first introduced to drones and computer vision which I didn't know until now that this was my passion.

										In the summers I would work at Raytheon BBN technologies and then MIT Lincoln Labratories. Throughout my time at WPI I developed a passion throughout my Java application projects, prototyping, and web development and design. Although, I recently found my focus and my niche that I know I will be pursuing further work on.

										Computer Vision fascinated me from the first day of my first graduate class at Worcester Polytechnic Institute taught by Nithin Sanket. It has been one of the most challenging classes I have taken but the most rewarding. 

										<br/>
										<br/>

										I continue to push myself everyday in that class as it is related to my Bimodal Quadruped project where I have to create an object tracking method and use SLAM. 

										<br/>
										<br/>

										I want to continue to work on working with autonomous robots and vehicles and be able to build computer vision for
